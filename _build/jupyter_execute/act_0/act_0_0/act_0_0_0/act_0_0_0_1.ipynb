    "It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of the `stata_kernel` package. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Installation**: Verify that the `stata_kernel` package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ~/documents/github/myenv/bin/python3.11 -m pip show stata_kernel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the package is not installed, you'll need to install it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ~/documents/github/myenv/bin/python3.11 -m pip install stata_kernel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correct Command**: The correct command to install the `stata_kernel` package for Jupyter notebooks is:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ~/documents/github/myenv/bin/python3.11 -m stata_kernel.install --user\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command should be run from outside the virtual environment. It seems you tried running it from within the virtual environment, which might be causing the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Jupyter Installation**: Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed in your virtual environment. You can check by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ~/documents/github/myenv/bin/python3.11 -m pip show jupyter\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   If Jupyter is not installed, you can install it using:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   ~/documents/github/myenv/bin/python3.11 -m pip install jupyter\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Kernel Configuration**: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you may need to manually configure the `stata_kernel` as a Jupyter kernel. You can do this by following the instructions in the `stata_kernel` documentation: [Stata Kernel Installation](https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/installation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update PATH**: Ensure that the path to your virtual environment is included in your system's PATH variable. This will ensure that Jupyter Notebook can find the `stata_kernel` installation. You can add it to your PATH temporarily by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export PATH=~/documents/github/myenv/bin:$PATH\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You may want to add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to make it permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these steps and let me know if you encounter any issues!\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Stata in a Jupyter notebook using the `stata_kernel`, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Activate Virtual Environment**: Activate your virtual environment where `stata_kernel` is installed. If it's not activated, you can do so with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   source ~/documents/github/myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Start Jupyter Notebook from within your virtual environment. Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter notebook\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a New Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on \"New\" and select \"Stata\" from the dropdown list of available kernels. This will create a new notebook using the Stata kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run Stata Code**: In the new notebook, you can now write and execute Stata code cells just like you would in a regular Stata session.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deactivate Virtual Environment**: When you're done using Stata, you can deactivate your virtual environment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   deactivate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to activate your virtual environment every time you want to use Stata in Jupyter Notebook, and deactivate it when you're finished. This ensures that you're using the correct environment and dependencies."
